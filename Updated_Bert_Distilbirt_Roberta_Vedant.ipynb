with hangouts the good it saves space there is more room for your message the bad it is too hidden my first hand experience was that it took me a while to discover the previous context menus for the send button and i am going to extrapolate here and guess that the average user will find the same problem and may never find this context menu to solve that we could either introduce a ui hint on first use or make it more hangouts y and i feel a ui hint would bee to complicated and a user may forget the feature basically for the time being we will still be getting issues reported where people

previous version i had the runs incrementing by iterations of k as you suggested but the deviation is fairly inconsistent and on some old devices the k increment and decrement was too large to hit the

put a colored dot use a deg badge overlaying an edge of the bubble or use a faint pattern with the resp color in the bg but the fact remains they re just obvious variations of the same namely coloring the bubble this has nothing to do with improving ux if it doesn t improve ux you have to ask yourself why do it and does it degrade ux horizontal bars yes can t be seen when the bubble is partly visible and at the top of the screen vertical bars yes harder to spot see than a fully colored bubble hci human computer interfaces are subject of scientific study being a designer does not make you an hci expert and vice versa this is a very common misconception tldr what some people here do not get is that good usability decisions are not made based on i like this it looks nice we have

constraints in this debate i often see people making points from their pov this is useless pun intended forget what you like and try to solely think who is the average user what do they want to do will this help them do it or make it harder you do not copy other apps because you don t want to innovate you copy them because messaging apps are not new there is only so much you can do in terms of innovative ux without punching average users in the face who have learned certain ux paradigms that all other apps use to convey certain concepts when you do something new you must never force people to learn something new if you can use a paradigm that is used in another app which matches your target audience but has several orders of magnitude more users e g whatsapp kakaotalk or fb messenger

them it is of the utmost importance not to confuse users but i don t see the point of continuing this discussion you guys obviously don t consider my points and i can do much more productive things

redundant it s ok to show that you manually verified but not obligatory to show it this gives false sense of the message being secure users will get annoyed when things leak even though they believe they did it right if the contact wasn t manually verified don t show that there might be wrong with the encryption you will confuse users showing a indication for this will cause trouble with users i guarantee it there will be confusion if you show indicator for no if you argue that it s important to let the user know that you can t trust the contact you could just as well argue that you cant trust a manually verified contact in case of compromised phones or w e the confusion will lead to trouble people make things up believing in wrong information and further spreading false information further confusing more people showing the indicator on the top bar of the chat causes issues in group chats and if there are old messages which were not manually verified rendering on top of each icon isn t this waste of resources clutter you could just check the contact information to verify i would leave no up for discussion but also point out that the indicator will be pointless as when something gets compromised it would could render the encryption pointless giving the user false sense of security users are experts at getting confused another important point is that the user wants to be spoon fed the app is suppose to work out of the box after all the user went through a complicated setup process to start the program the first time telling the user that it further has to manually verify each contact makes them want to uninstall it because they believe the app wouldn t work anyhow without out some additional hardcore hacker steps don t rely on colours to deliver information colourblindness is an issue and ignoring it isn t going to solve it the app isn t tailored for you alone bringing color blind people up is a valid point but we can not make design choices

poor eye sight people with glasses and may have other handicaps don t make things difficult you are here to serve them the app is confusing annoying as it is just by switching chat client users get

like or should be shown on the main conversation i wouldn t mind if no is shown in the contact details but this idea shares flaws with the idea of showing a indicator on the top bar that it won t show which messages were verified the reason i say it shouldn t be shown in the main conversation is that it s still a false sense of security but then again you could argue the same for the padlock i d say that the difference is that the novice user expect the app to encrypt stuff and the padlock indicates that adding another indicator to further implicate security is scary to them this is my

which will then save that link into a session this is our default state but your points are both very good the fenix logo doesn t look like a button it reduces the space for page title so now i m thinking that by default our custom tab shouldn t come with any toolbar button open in firefox fenix is now the last link inside the overflow menu doing this frees up quite a bit of additional space that we can use to show page title what do you think mheubusch wrote am not sure if what you are suggesting is that this is the default and a developer could move this action to the overflow menu or are you suggesting that this would be a text link in the overflow menu and a developer could add whatever they want there even without our own toolbar action a developer can still have their own doing this will leave less space for page title but it means more flexibility for developers and many developers will choose not to use that precious space we have moved our open in fenix action into the overflow menu but a developer can also have their own item there hopefully most developers will choose this option it should be noted that a developer can have both a custom toolbar action and a custom overflow menu item just for completion s sake a developer can also recolour the toolbar to make it more seamless with their app', 'can we consider delegating this to pocket', 'i ll try to shed

allow location need android system access yes although we need to show the android system dialogue which we cannot alter in any way before showing our own location permission itself is simple allow sitename to use your location don t ask me again on this site don t allow allow camera need android system access yes this permission is complicated by the fact that the user will need to pick a camera before proceeding in the future the user may elect to pick another camera fennec handles problem by showing a drop down menu that will appear on top of the existing modal dialogue fenix will handle it by using radio buttons we re pretty confident that the radio buttons won t ever overcrowd the screen because smartphones don t have that many cameras available to use fennec handles problem by re showing the same dialogue we will handle it by rewriting the dialogue the first time around we say allow sitename to use your camera don t allow allow every other time after that we say select camera to use cancel ok dialogue shown on subsequent triggers microphone need android system access yes this permission behaves and looks identically to camera permission instead of saying allow sitename to use your camera select camera to use we say allow sitename to use your microphone select microphone to use dialogue shown on subsequent triggers camera microphone together this permission behaves and looks identically to camera and microphone permissions but there s a twist how do we show a list of cameras and microphones in one modal dialogue android system solves this problem by showing one dialogue after the other and labelling them of and of fenix will solve this problem not by using two drop down menus instead we will show the radio list of microphones right underneath the list of cameras on subsequent times we will again modify the string slightly system dialogue shown first fenix dialogue shown after the user taps allow on system dialogue dialogue shown on subsequent triggers bluetooth need android system access no when a site wants to pair with another device via bluetooth fenix will show a dialogue that says pair sitename with device device device etc cancel pair consider including a loading indicator to the top right corner of this dialogue to make it clear that fenix will keep searching for connectible bluetooth devices as long as this dialogue remains open local storage need android system access yes we say allow sitename to permanently store data on your device don t allow allow question does this permission also apply to times when the user needs

the management does not show any signs of understanding we have to take action this is why i will now explain again what the problem with your answer is and what it indicates hi all cto of duckduckgo here i thought it might be helpful if i briefly shared some of our internal thinking around this issue so folks can see how we got here and how we plan to move forward your internal thinking is what has raised this issue in public it is basically the bare reason for our concerns because it shows that you do not even understand our privacy argument it is not about the bug it is your action and the like calimeroteknik puts it curios wording that makes it appear like you have not understood our critic at all time of events tritonio found a curios line of code that sends unnecessary requests to one of your backends tagawa said the purpose of the request you observed is to retrieve a website s favicon so that it can be displayed in certain places within the app or on the results page https github com duckduckgo android pull files diff ac c d fe e d c then stefan and later we said please stop this there is no reason to send data in the first place a big part of privacy focused software is to avoid to creating unnecessary data in the first place it is not necessary please do not send our browser history or any unnecessary request to any server no matter how secure this server is please load the favicon locally we love you and we do not like heartbreaks in the worst case security is only a illusion only the hacker with root access knows what is really going on and maybe like tritonio indicates microsoft dgg show no real understanding and argues in a curios way and now you nilnilnil continue bugs can happen bad decisions can happen but arguing with trust us it anonymous it saves user badwidth and its the only visible attribute on top of that we already have a anonymous service it is pure poison for trust because it indicates you entirely missed the point either on purpose or not both would be alarming the logic behind how we ve been displaying favicons in our apps is a function of how we operate our private search engine since we already have an anonymous favicon service through our search engine using it has a number of benefits it avoids more requests to known non anonymous websites that are visited it s way faster since it runs server side saves user bandwidth and the only externally visible attribute is that the app is connecting to duckduckgo com as the favicon location is actually encrypted in the path in transit to our team utilizing this anonymous service we had made for the search engine seemed like an optimal principled choice across a set of criteria its not that we do not understand your reasoning or the reasoning of tagawa the problem is your reasoning seems to entirely miss our point now you continue as cto this indicates no real insight at all we want to be clear that at no point was the actual visited domain otherwise exposed this favicon service is fully anonymous on our end and url parameters like the favicon domain are encrypted in transit just like the search engine with search queries this is also why when this issue was raised in the past we decided to keep the solution as is at no point was this ignored we said please do not mix the search engine code and your browser code they should not relate on each other if not necessary for example if the user actually wants to do a search on ddg arguing we already have a anonymous service is very hard to understand from a technical point of view it might make sense for a cfo but not for nerds or hackers however we understand that there is an alternative method of getting the favicons locally that a lot of folks prefer while still maintaining our privacy standards we also believe that method is in line with our product vision of privacy simplified considering its a somewhat simpler method than the one we had been using like calimeroteknik already said luckily higher security standards meet your standard so we went ahead today and implemented the change for both android and ios duckduckgo ios that will move this logic onto the client and we will no longer be using the favicon service in our apps these changes are currently in the release phase and are rolling out live now you only took this action after enormous public pressure there was no sign of insight or internal intention to resolve this this is why you have been compared with bigcorp because they act like this or like pointed out by some people are even doing a better job than you handling these kinds of issues larp mode on loading game data you currently have quests closed quest even under enormous public pressure do not remove the criticized code before at least one year has past open quest understand the whole point and communicate it in a acceptable way bonus quest build trust back by transparent actions in the future which reflect that you understood what we said larp mode off we really appreciate the feedback and exchange of ideas on this topic and on ways to further improve the privacy of our products in general you are welcome i hope this helps',

a problem i enjoy doing these kinds of things and being able to work on a piece of software that i actually use alongside the developers is for lack of a better term wicked awesome really here it should perform a search just like if you enter foo site example com yes i did not consider this i wonder if instead what we need is to check if any other apps could handle it inside specialurldetector buildintent function and if no other app could handle it treat it like a query i had originally thought about doing something like this but upon more careful consideration i thought the regex method might deliver a more stable user experience i ll illustrate this with a thought provoking magnification of a semi real ish problem i don t like how if i am for example on www superimportantwebsite eu nl co uk and click on a valid intent link for which no specialized handler is available that the browser would navigate away from the super important page and redirect me to a search engine i personally think it s best in this case to err on the side of staying on the current page and i feel like the end user should have a somewhat reasonable expectation of this behavior as well when clicking on certain links especially in the case of a hypothetical http link that may redirect to an intent link this would be especially frustrating for the user staying on the page and giving a toast also gives the user a better idea of what s going on i feel many users wouldn t understand that they need to install an app to open this kind of link and would be very confused to see a search query launched perhaps some kind of dialog box asking the user if they would like to launch a search query would alleviate these concerns somewhat but it would still not be a behavior that i as a user would expect i propose that we keep the regex see new commit but i am all about that hashtag respect and would like to hear your thoughts on this as i trust your judgment over my own and would only want to keep the regex if you agreed it was preferable in light of the concerns i ve raised i do like the idea of trying to launch a search query if no handler is available but i feel like we might need an entire intenturiutilities kt class with some more complex logic to implement this well if you disagree with my thought process i would be happy to implement the packagemanager fix you suggested and test it for you the concerns i raised about it aren t really as bad as my paradoxical illustrative rant made them out to be and i do understand that to some extent the problems i referenced will always exist in some capacity i just feel like the regex would be a slightly safer option for the time being i may have over complicated things in the new commit but i thought it was more interesting to implement it the way i did as opposed to hard coding the site string into the regex and it s nice to have a separate blacklist string to make future additions subtractions testing

only app shouldn t be a problem but dropping new android versions isn t our choice for now', 'a better solution might be one which only displays nonzero error codes but i still want the full removal its just so much cleaner for oneshot scripts cgarz i am just curious why you want nonzero exit codes hidden also', 'you can do any mental gymnastics you want here but it does not forbid downloading and running third party code only modifying already installed apk and yes later they updated policy with malicious behavior that denied third party code download execution it s not possible for an app to modify the installed apk at a technical level the policy used to state that apps couldn t modify replace or update the code extending it counts as updating it too as bringing in the new code is an update apps obviously can t touch the apk itself since the os doesn t permit them to do that their policies are not listing out things that are implemented by the os sandbox and permission model because you re forbidden from exploiting it in general i think it s ridiculous for you to make these disingenuous misrepresentations of the policies and then claim that i m the one doing mental gymnastics it would be completely fair to disagree with the policy and argue that the drawbacks of the limitations it imposes are not worth the security advantages that it provides that s not a debate about the facts but rather the value of allowing apps in the play store to do whatever they want vs them policing it part of them being able to police it is being able to review and analyze the code used by apps which they can t do if the code is dynamically downloaded from outside the play store separately from that having non read only code is a security issue in general and the system packaging system provides substantial security by not allowing apps to write to their code including native executables and libraries it has extracted when installing apps with apt on a system like debian the same thing is true and in general very few apps will install code to your home directory because it s a bad practice with security issues disabling in memory and on disk code generation to improve security is an extremely common practice on traditional linux distributions too even web developers without systems programming knowledge are taught to make their server side code read only for the web application server user so a file write vulnerability is not arbitrary code execution it s part of security i certainly agree that the policy is unfortunate for use cases like termux and that it will be painful to adapt it to an approach like apk based packages i do think an approach like that is viable and it wouldn t make using it substantially worse unless you need to compile download and run native code for development it won t impact development in scripting languages like python other than installing libraries with native code which could be packaged by termux via apks in the same way it does definitely throw a wrench into native code development workflows since you would need a system for generating an apk packaging up your code i don t think that s completely awful though and it would be neat to be able to generate a standalone apk out of the code not depending on termux which is definitely feasible it could package termux into the generated apk with the user code yea that is the main point road to hell is paved with good intentions earlier call recorders now termux servers for those who came to android because it was platform that would allow doing advanced stuff those changes are big evil call recording is still often provided by the base os along with screen recording capturing audio it s also worth noting that only the native telephony layer calls are impacted at all an app like whatsapp or signal is fully allowed to provide call recording for their own calling implementation if they choose there are regulations on the legacy telephone infrastructure for call recording and they are expected by the authorities in some regions to prevent it or at least to add a notice that the call is being recorded i suggest avoiding telephony layer text and voice calls in the first place because they aren t secure and in practice many people organizations are able to listen in on them if they choose apps like termux are still allowed and possible the part that s disallowed is the internal apt based package management but it was also disallowed since at least anyway the selinux policies just hadn t advanced to the point that they made the assumption apps didn t violate the policy to implement a mitigation of course bad because it is taking freedom due to security in my dictionary it is never good of course it would be possible to implement properly by letting user choose he wants app executing external code or not simply add a permission and issue is resolved same goes to other breaking changes that users are still unhappy about like saf call recorders that model doesn t work even for experienced power users and developers apps are in a position to coerce users into accepting permissions they choose not to implement fallbacks for example an app could respond to being denied the contacts permission by using the api for having the user pick contacts to provide to the app which requires no permission are you aware of any app doing that the same goes for storage access and camera access they could ask for what they want and then fall back to a working implementation without a bulk data access permission however they don t as they know users have to say yes to get done what they want to get done the alternative is removing an app which is often not even an option unless you want to lose your job make your friends upset etc a better way of doing it is having the user in control of exactly what is granted like picking which contacts or groups of contacts an app is provided with or which subset of the storage is provided saf etc android has had the better way of doing things in many areas for a long time such as saf being introduced in it s no good if it s not what the ecosystem uses even as a fallback i m not sure why people would be unhappy about the storage changes since those only put users in control and they can still grant apps access to everything look at termux itself for a good implementation of part of saf it has a storage provider exposing the internal storage to the file manager you can move files directories in and out of termux without trusting it to access anything else the other part of the picture is apps requesting access to external files directories outside of their own scope which is something termux could do although i don t think it s worth implementing the existing implementation is already solid yea you sure who are those people who want that maybe same people that wanted saf forced on them or denied call recording only read angry comments about those i certainly care about the privacy and security of my device i ve always been incredibly unhappy with the way that external as in shared between apps storage worked the storage changes as fantastic from my perspective and don t eliminate any capabilities termux won t have an issue with that it can choose to provide more saf based functionality or not since the existing functionality is already fine no there are not you can t be sure any of those will be allowed in future as it seems to have become unpredictable one rule change and google will deny any apps that include emulator or packing binary code in lib dir only loading so file with jni it s not at all unpredictable there was no change in policy beyond more aggressive wording and considering apps violating it to be malicious you d probably argue that their new wording allows apps to add and run new code dynamically outside a sandbox because they specifically state downloaded but the intent of the policy is as clear as it has always been trying to find loopholes in the wording doesn t work with these things it s not code or a technical implementation of rules like selinux policy it works like a code of law where it is interpreted by humans and intent of the creators of the law is what matters you have the option to avoid it by avoiding the play store in which case you re only restricted by the os

m wondering about with the globalscope and that s when you want to do a fire forget kind of operation that you don t want to tie to the activity lifecycle do you think it would make sense to introduce

it s necessary to introduce an application scope as globalscope is technically an application scope right say you want to perform some action leave the current screen and then show the result in a snackbar on after the action completes you can t use the viewmodelscope so you re stuck with globalscope but that s an overkill and if the action get stuck you ll leak a coroutine a way to solve this would be if you could supply a coroutine scope from the calling viewmodel to one being called it really depends on the usage and architecture of your activities fragments if the screens share the same activity you can still tie vm s lifecycle to the activity and share the scope between the fragments i don t think there is anything else we could tie it to but fragment activity application service right as for the snackbar scenario if you want to show the snackbar no matter the screen i think it s a valid use case for an eventbus wdyt for example saving a post when leaving the editor is something we don t want to tie to the viewmodel lifecycle but i think it s perfectly fine for it to happen a bit later when the system is ready yeah i think saving a post would ideally be handled by a service service can be easily automatically restored when it s killed on the other hand saving something into db should be very quick and using a service for such case seems like an overkill moreover

advanced section of the main settings screen export bottom sheet if the user choses to export content the available options can be presented using a bottom sheet delete site dialog this is the major shift but potentially a worthwhile one as it focuses much more on the exact task at hand if the user choses the delete site option they are presented with a dialog that mentions exactly that it still warns them of the content removal and still requires an input to confirm however the input however might be better utilized as the account password since it is more traditional to be required for a

save to the db then only show on the screen whatever comes from the db my guess would be you ll always have a consistent state was there any other problem we could deal with update having talked on slack here s why i still think it s good to have a pull to refresh and at the same time should be easy to implement if you load the data from the server and then save to the db consistently then only show on the screen whatever comes from the db you ll always have a consistent state no need to sync just use the db as a buffer and to cover edge cases when we re offline but still want to show the list to the user as a matter of fact if the user wanted to do anything with it like removing or adding a new follower they will inevitably need a connection so no need to worry about syncing but rather just taking whatever comes from the server and pushing it to the db clearing the former contents each time now having said all that i agree the followers section content shouldn t change that much so refreshing the screen might not be used often but still having a pull to refresh on all lists is something i as a user would intuitively expect if i m used to do that on almost every other

this has not been discussed before n n description n nhello r n r nlike many people using firefly i think u f i m using the recurring transactions feature i use it mainly to track monthly transactions like rent public transportation card energy r nthe problem that i m facing is that every transaction created by the reccuring rule have the exact same infomations except for the date same amount same description same notes so it may be a bit difficult to quickly see for which month a given transaction applies to n n solution n ni propose to add some kind of placeholder feature to the transaction description so that a part of the description can be dynamically filled based on the context the transaction is created in r n r nthis could allow for example to fill the name of the current month the current year or even the current day though i couldn t find any real use case for the last one there could also be other placeholders but i couldn t find any use case either r n r nfor example the reccuring transaction defined with description rent month year would generate the following transactions r n rent july r n rent august r n rent september r n r n r n proposed placeholders r n year the current year in long form ex r n year short the last two digits of the year ex r n previous year the last year in long form ex r n previous year short the last two digits of the last year ex r n month the name of the current month ex september r n month short the two digits value of the month ex r n previous month the name of the previous month ex august r n previous month short the two digits value of the previous month ex r n day the two digits value of the current day ex r n r nthe month names should be translated in the user language n n what are alternatives n ni could manually edit the transactions each month but this kinda defeat the purpose of the recurring transactions n n additional context n n no response', 'bumps predis predis https github com predis predis from to n

difficult disallowing data from being executed is part of the basics of security they really should have done this from the start and then come up with a way for apps like termux to obtain permission to deviate from it but android started out with a wild west anything goes approach and has had to make painful changes over time instead the end goal would be to forbid generating and running native

going to be anything blocking building and running code on a device but you need to be aware that the vehicle for that is an apk i e bundle the libraries executables into an apk and run them from there you can use shared uid apks where there s a central one with the base code and then others providing more libraries executables these changes aren t going to prevent this only doing it without

discussed on slack i understand you have considered this and decided it was not necessary atm i ll take that as an answer just wanted to leave it here code i made a few comments here and there in the

from the db my guess would be you ll always have a consistent state was there any other problem we could deal with update having talked on slack here s why i still think it s good to have a pull to refresh and at the same time should be easy to implement if you load the data from the server and then save to the db consistently then only show on the screen whatever comes from the db you ll always have a consistent state no need to sync just use the db as a buffer and to cover edge cases when we re offline but still want to show the list to the user as a matter of fact if the user wanted to do anything with it like removing or adding a new follower they will inevitably need a connection so no need to worry about syncing but rather just taking whatever comes from the server and pushing it to the db clearing the former contents each time now having said all that i agree the followers section content shouldn t change that much so refreshing the screen might not be used often but still having a pull to refresh on all lists is something i as a user would intuitively expect if i m used to do that on almost every other list in the app plus the burden of implementing it in the simplified way not syncing but rather just stepping over the db each time is really small', 'it has reduced to a significant extent but sometimes it happened again after automatic closure i have to re

case later now it seems to be a good time to discuss i can surely bring the immediately label down and let the user see the date with no special handling which seems like the common sense expectation

here but it does not forbid downloading and running third party code only modifying already installed apk and yes later they updated policy with malicious behavior that denied third party code download execution it s not possible for an app to modify the installed apk at a technical level the policy used to state that apps couldn t modify replace or update the code extending it counts as updating it too as bringing in the new code is an update apps obviously can t touch the apk itself since the os doesn t permit them to do that their policies are not listing out things that are implemented by the os sandbox and permission model because you re forbidden from exploiting it in general i think it s ridiculous for you to make these disingenuous misrepresentations of the policies and then claim that i m the one doing mental gymnastics it would be completely fair to disagree with the policy and argue that the drawbacks of the limitations it imposes are not worth the security advantages that it provides that s not a debate about the facts but rather the value of allowing apps in the play store to do whatever they want vs them policing it part of them being able to police it is being able to review and analyze the code used by apps which they can t do if the code is dynamically downloaded from outside the play store separately from that having non read only code is a security issue in general and the system packaging system provides substantial security by not allowing apps to write to their code including native executables and libraries it has extracted when installing apps with apt on a system like debian the same thing is true and in general very few apps will install code to your home directory because it s a bad practice with security issues disabling in memory and on disk code generation to improve security is an extremely common practice on traditional linux distributions too even web developers without systems programming knowledge are taught to make their server side code read only for the web application server user so a file write vulnerability is not arbitrary code execution it s part of security i certainly agree that the policy is unfortunate for use cases like termux and that it will be painful to adapt it to an approach like apk based packages i do think an approach like that is viable and it wouldn t make using it substantially worse unless you need to compile download and run native code for development it won t impact development in scripting languages like python other than installing libraries with native code which could be packaged by termux via apks in the same way it does definitely throw a wrench into native code development workflows since you would need a system for generating an apk packaging up your code i don t think that s completely awful though and it would be neat to be able to generate a standalone apk out of the code not depending on termux which is definitely feasible it could package termux into the generated apk with the user code yea that is the main point road to hell is paved with good intentions earlier call recorders now termux servers for those who came to android because it was platform that would allow doing advanced stuff those changes are big evil call recording is still often provided by the base os along with screen recording capturing audio it s also worth noting that only the native telephony layer calls are impacted at all an app like whatsapp or signal is fully allowed to provide call recording for their own calling implementation if they choose there are regulations on the legacy telephone infrastructure for call recording and they are expected by the authorities in some regions to prevent it or at least to add a notice that the call is being recorded i suggest avoiding telephony layer text and voice calls in the first place because they aren t secure and in practice many people organizations are able to listen in on them if they choose apps like termux are still allowed and possible the part that s disallowed is the internal apt based package management but it was also disallowed since at least anyway the selinux policies just hadn t advanced to the point that they made the assumption apps didn t violate the policy to implement a mitigation of course bad because it is taking freedom due to security in my dictionary it is never good of course it would be possible to implement properly by letting user choose he wants app executing external code or not simply add a permission and issue is resolved same goes to other breaking changes that users are still unhappy about like saf call recorders that model doesn t work even for experienced power users and developers apps are in a position to coerce users into accepting permissions they choose not to implement fallbacks for example an app could respond to being denied the contacts permission by using the api for having the user pick contacts to provide to the app which requires no permission are you aware of any app doing that the same goes for storage access and camera access they could ask for what they want and then fall back to a working implementation without a bulk data access permission however they don t as they know users have to say yes to get done what they want to get done the alternative is removing an app which is often not even an option unless you want to lose your job make your friends upset etc a better way of doing it is having the user in control of exactly what is granted like picking which contacts or groups of contacts an app is provided with or which subset of the storage is provided saf etc android has had the better way of doing things in many areas for a long time such as saf being introduced in it s no good if it s not what the ecosystem uses even as a fallback i m not sure why people would be unhappy about the storage changes since those only put users in control and they can still grant apps access to everything look at termux itself for a good implementation of part of saf it has a storage provider exposing the internal storage to the file manager you can move files directories in and out of termux without trusting it to access anything else the other part of the picture is apps requesting access to external files directories outside of their own scope which is something termux could do although i don t think it s worth implementing the existing implementation is already solid yea you sure who are those people who want that maybe same people that wanted saf forced on them or denied call recording only read angry comments about those i certainly care about the privacy and security of my device i ve always been incredibly unhappy with the way that external as in shared between apps storage worked the storage changes as fantastic from my perspective and don t eliminate any capabilities termux won t have an issue with that it can choose to provide more saf based functionality or not since the existing functionality is already fine no there are not you can t be sure any of those will be allowed in future as it seems to have become unpredictable one rule change and google will deny any apps that include emulator or packing binary code in lib dir only loading so file with jni it s not at all unpredictable there was no change in policy beyond more aggressive wording and considering apps violating it to be malicious you d probably argue that their new wording allows apps to add and run new code dynamically outside a sandbox because they specifically state downloaded but the intent of the policy is as clear as it has always been trying to find loopholes in the wording doesn t work with these things it s not code or a technical implementation of rules like selinux policy it works like a code of law where it is interpreted by humans and intent of the creators of the law is what matters you have the option to avoid it by avoiding the play store in

i wonder if instead what we need is to check if any other apps could handle it inside specialurldetector buildintent function and if no other app could handle it treat it like a query i had originally thought about doing something like this but upon more careful consideration i thought the regex method might deliver a more stable user experience i ll illustrate this with a thought provoking magnification of a semi real ish problem i don t like how if i am for example on www superimportantwebsite eu nl co uk and click on a valid intent link for which no specialized handler is available that the browser would navigate away from the super important page and redirect me to a search engine i personally think it s best in this case to err on the side of staying on the current page and i feel like the end user should have a somewhat reasonable expectation of this behavior as well when clicking on certain links especially in the case of a hypothetical http link that may redirect to an intent link this would be especially frustrating for the user staying on the page and giving a toast also gives the user a better idea of what s going on i feel many users wouldn t understand that they need to install an app to open this kind of link and would be very confused to see a search query launched perhaps some kind of dialog box asking the user if they would like to launch a search query would alleviate these concerns somewhat but it would still not be a behavior that i as a user would expect i propose that we keep the regex see new commit but i am all about that hashtag respect and would like to hear your thoughts on this as i trust your judgment over my own and would only want to keep the regex if you agreed it was preferable in light of the concerns i ve raised i do like the idea of trying to launch a search query if no handler is available but i feel like we might need an entire intenturiutilities kt class with some more complex logic to implement this well if you disagree with my thought process i would be happy to implement the packagemanager fix you suggested and test it for you the concerns i raised about it aren t really as bad as my paradoxical illustrative rant made them out to be and i do understand that to some extent the problems i referenced will always exist in some capacity i just feel like the regex would be a slightly safer option for the time being i may have over complicated things in the new commit but i thought it was more interesting to implement it the way i did as opposed to hard coding the site string into the regex and it s nice to have a separate blacklist string to make future additions subtractions testing simpler the string is generated via a dummy arraylist whose sole purpose is to help generate the blacklist string with a predictable format in an abstract manner i m really not sure if this is the best idea however and would like to hear your input on this thank you for taking the time to read this sir

manually verified don t show that there might be wrong with the encryption you will confuse users showing a indication for this will cause trouble with users i guarantee it there will be confusion if you show indicator for no if you argue that it s important to let the user know that you can t trust the contact you could just as well argue that you cant trust a manually verified contact in case of compromised phones or w e the confusion will lead to trouble people make things up believing in wrong information and further spreading false information further confusing more people showing the indicator on the top bar of the chat causes issues in group chats and if there are old messages which were not manually verified rendering on top of each icon isn t this waste of resources clutter you could just check the contact information to verify i would leave no up for discussion but also point out that the indicator will be pointless as when something gets compromised it would could render the encryption pointless giving the user false sense of security users are experts at getting confused another important point is that the user wants to be spoon fed the app is suppose to work out of the box after all the user went through a complicated setup process to start the program the first time telling the user that it further has to manually verify each contact makes them want to uninstall it because they believe the app wouldn t work anyhow without out some additional hardcore hacker steps don t rely on colours to deliver information colourblindness is an issue and ignoring

the contact details but this idea shares flaws with the idea of showing a indicator on the top bar that it won t show which messages were verified the reason i say it shouldn t be shown in the main conversation is that it s still a false sense of security but then again you could argue the same for the padlock i d say that the difference is that the novice user expect the app to encrypt stuff

remains they re just obvious variations of the same namely coloring the bubble this has nothing to do with improving ux if it doesn t improve ux you have to ask yourself why do it and does it degrade

point about b despite all conclusions from before pointing to a lacking such data as we do here we re down to logic reasoning good usability is done by people who have lots of experience analyzing a use case and devising an interface considering all constraints in this debate i often see people making points from their pov this is useless pun intended forget what you like and try to solely think who is the average user what do they want to do will this help them do it or make it harder you do not copy other apps because you don t want to innovate you copy them because messaging apps are not

the url originally i was going to give users one tap access to open links from third party apps in fenix which will then save that link into a session this is our default state but your points are both very good the fenix logo doesn t look like a button it reduces the space for page title so now i m thinking that by default our custom tab shouldn t come with any toolbar button open in firefox fenix is now the last link inside the overflow menu doing this frees up quite a bit of additional space that we can use to show page title what do you think mheubusch wrote am not sure if what you are suggesting is that this is the default and a developer could move this action to the overflow menu or are you suggesting that this would be a text link in the overflow menu and a developer could add whatever they want there even without our own toolbar action a developer can still have their own doing this will leave less space for page title but it means more flexibility for developers and many developers will choose not to use that precious space we have moved our open in fenix action into the overflow menu but a developer can also have their own item there hopefully most developers will

it can grant access to individual sites fennec already has a way to handle permission prompts i won t attempt to reinvent the wheel here instead i will simply try to align the visual design to fenix s house style let s tackle them one by one notifications need android system access no this permissions is the most straightforward of all no system dialogue no don t ask me we simply say allow sitename to send notifications don t allow allow location need android system access yes although we need to show the android system dialogue which we cannot alter in any way before showing our own location permission itself is simple allow sitename to use your location don t ask me again on this site don t allow allow camera need android system access yes this permission is complicated by the fact that the user will need to pick a camera before proceeding in the future the user may elect to pick another camera fennec handles problem by showing a drop down menu that will appear on top of the existing modal dialogue fenix will handle it by using radio buttons we re pretty confident that the radio buttons won t ever overcrowd the screen because smartphones don t have that many cameras available to use fennec handles problem by re showing the same dialogue we will handle it by rewriting the dialogue the first time around we say allow sitename to use your camera don t allow allow every other time after that we say select camera to use cancel ok dialogue shown on subsequent triggers microphone need android system access yes this permission behaves and looks identically to camera permission instead of saying allow sitename to use your camera select camera to use we say allow sitename to use your microphone select microphone to use dialogue shown on subsequent triggers camera microphone together this permission behaves and looks identically to camera and microphone permissions but there s a twist how do we show a list of cameras and microphones in one modal dialogue android system solves this problem by showing one dialogue after the other and labelling them of and of fenix will solve this problem not by using two drop down menus instead we will show the radio list of microphones right underneath the list of cameras on subsequent times we will again modify the string slightly system dialogue shown first fenix dialogue shown after the user taps allow on system dialogue dialogue shown on subsequent triggers bluetooth need android system access no when a site wants to pair with another device via bluetooth fenix will show a dialogue that says pair sitename with device device device etc cancel pair consider including a loading indicator to the top right corner of this dialogue to make it clear that fenix will keep searching for connectible bluetooth devices as long as this dialogue remains open local storage need android system access yes we say allow sitename to permanently store data on your device don t allow allow question does this

believe it is still valid but maybe there is a better way i agree that globalscope is valid for such usecases i m not sure if it s necessary to introduce an application scope as globalscope is technically an application scope right say you want to perform some action leave the current screen and then show the result in a snackbar on after the action completes you can t use the viewmodelscope so you re stuck with globalscope but that s an overkill and if the action get stuck you ll leak a coroutine a way to solve this would be if you could supply a coroutine scope from the calling viewmodel to one being called it really depends on the usage and architecture of your activities fragments if the screens share the same activity you can still tie vm s lifecycle to the activity and share the scope between the fragments i don t think there is anything else we could tie it to but fragment activity application service right as for the snackbar scenario if you want to show the snackbar no matter the screen i think it s a valid use case for an eventbus wdyt for example saving a post when leaving the editor is something we don t want to tie to the viewmodel lifecycle but i think it s perfectly fine for it to happen a bit later when the system is ready yeah i think saving a post would ideally be handled by a service service can be easily automatically restored when it s killed on the other hand saving something into db should be very quick and using a service for such case seems like an overkill moreover we d need to send the data in a bundle and we might exceed

necessary in the first place we normally do not rise up from our cellars because we code but now where the realms of management and c d collide again and the management does not show any signs of understanding we have to take action this is why i will now explain again what the problem with your answer is and what it indicates hi all cto of duckduckgo here i thought it might be helpful if i briefly shared some of our internal thinking around this issue so folks can see how we got here and how we plan to move forward your internal thinking is what has raised this issue in public it is basically the bare reason for our concerns because it shows that you do not even understand our privacy argument it is not about the bug it is your action and the like calimeroteknik puts it curios wording that makes it appear like you have not understood our critic at all time of events tritonio found a curios line of code that sends unnecessary requests to one of your backends tagawa said the purpose of the request you observed is to retrieve a website s favicon so that it can be displayed in certain places within the app or on the results page https github com duckduckgo android pull files diff ac c d fe e d c then stefan and later we said please stop this there is no reason to send data in the first place a big part of privacy focused software is to avoid to creating unnecessary data in the first place it is not necessary please do not send our browser history or any unnecessary request to any server no matter how secure this server is please load the favicon locally we love you and we do not like heartbreaks in the worst case security is only a illusion only the hacker with root access knows what is really going on and maybe like tritonio indicates microsoft dgg show no real understanding and argues in a curios way and now you nilnilnil continue bugs can happen bad decisions can happen but arguing with trust us it anonymous it saves user badwidth and its the only visible attribute on top of that we already have a anonymous service it is pure poison for trust because it indicates you entirely missed the point either on purpose or not both would be alarming the logic behind how we ve been displaying favicons in our apps is a function of how we operate our private search engine since we already have an anonymous favicon service through our search engine using it has a number of benefits it avoids more requests to known non anonymous websites that are visited it s way faster since it runs server side saves user bandwidth and the only externally visible attribute is that the app is connecting to duckduckgo com as the favicon location is actually encrypted in the path in transit to our team utilizing this anonymous service we had made for the search engine seemed like an optimal principled choice across a set of criteria its not that we do not understand your reasoning or the reasoning of tagawa the problem is your reasoning seems to entirely miss our point now you continue as cto this indicates no real insight at all we want to be clear that at no point was the actual visited domain otherwise exposed this favicon service is fully anonymous on our end and url parameters like the favicon domain are encrypted in transit just like the search engine with search queries this is also why when this issue was raised in the past we decided to keep the solution as is at no point was this ignored we said please do not mix the search engine code and your browser code they should not relate on each other if not necessary for example if the user actually wants to do a search on ddg arguing we already have a anonymous service is very hard to understand from a technical point of view it might make sense for a cfo but not for nerds or hackers however we understand that there is an alternative method of getting the favicons locally that a lot of folks prefer while still maintaining our privacy standards we also believe that method is in line with our product vision of privacy simplified considering its a somewhat simpler method than the one we had been using like calimeroteknik already said luckily higher security standards meet your standard so we went ahead today and implemented the change for both android and ios duckduckgo ios that will move this logic onto the client and we will no longer be using the favicon service in our apps these changes are currently in the release phase and are rolling out live now you only took this action after enormous public pressure there was no sign of insight or internal intention to resolve this this is why you have been compared with bigcorp because they act like this or like pointed out by some people are even doing a better job than you handling these

r n r n is your feature proposal related to a problem r n r nno not a real problem more an enhancement for more convenience when intersections are consolidated with consolidate intersections all the

description same notes so it may be a bit difficult to quickly see for which month a given transaction applies to n n solution n ni propose to add some kind of placeholder feature to the transaction description so that a part of the description can be dynamically filled based on the context the transaction is created in r n r nthis could allow for example to fill the name of the current month the current year or even the current day though i couldn t find any real use case for the last one there could also be other placeholders but i couldn t find any use case either r n r nfor example the reccuring transaction defined with description rent month year would generate the following transactions r n rent july r n rent august r n rent september r n r n r n proposed placeholders r n year the current year in long form ex r n year short the last two digits of the year ex r n previous year the last year in long form ex r n previous year short the last two digits of the last year ex r n month
